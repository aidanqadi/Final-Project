1. Five Questions to Explore
1. Which products generate the most revenue?
Identify the top-10 SKUs by total sales to guide inventory and promotion decisions.
2. How do sales trend over time?
Analyze monthly/seasonal patterns to help the company plan for peak demand and staffing.
3. How can customers be segmented by RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary)?
Cluster customers into high-value, at-risk, and occasional groups to tailor marketing campaigns.
4. Which countries (outside the UK) contribute most to international revenue?
Discover high-growth regions for potential localized marketing or new distribution channels.
5. What’s the relationship between unit price and quantity sold?
Examine whether discounts (lower unit price) reliably drive larger order quantities or erode margins.
2. Potential Client & Value
